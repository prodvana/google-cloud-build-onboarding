# google-cloud-build-onboarding
This repo contains steps for onboarding Google Cloud Build workload onto Prodvana.

Google Cloud Build will be triggered via a [Runtime Extension](https://docs.prodvana.io/docs/runtime-extensions) running on a control Kubernetes cluster.

This tutorial is broken down into a series of steps, each with their own README and supporting files.

The full example configs can be found under `full-examples/`.
